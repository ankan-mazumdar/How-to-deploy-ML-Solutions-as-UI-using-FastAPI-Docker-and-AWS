#Docker, and AWS

Lets walk through the steps of deploying a machine learning (ML) solution using FastAPI, Docker, and AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS). We will cover creating an API using FastAPI, containerizing the API with Docker, pushing the Docker image to Docker Hub, and finally deploying the container on AWS.

Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.10+
Docker
AWS CLI configured with your credentials
Docker Hub account
1. Creating the FastAPI Search API
1.1 Setting Up the Project
First, create a directory for your project and initialize a Python environment:

bash
Copy code
mkdir fastapi-ml-deploy
cd fastapi-ml-deploy
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
1.2 Writing the API Code
